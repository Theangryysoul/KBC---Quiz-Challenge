# KBC - Quiz Challenge 🎉❓

Welcome to **KBC**, a fun and interactive quiz game inspired by Kaun Banega Crorepati! Test your knowledge across science, history, geography, literature, and more with 20 challenging questions. 🧠✨

## How it works 📝

- The program displays one question at a time with four multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D).
- Input your answer by typing the letter corresponding to your choice (e.g., `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`).
- Correct answers increase your points exponentially! 🚀
- A wrong answer on the first question ends the game with an encouraging message.  
- Wrong answers after some progress let you keep your points earned so far. 💰
- Answer all questions correctly to win the maximum prize! 🎊🏆

## How to run 💻

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Run the script via terminal or command prompt:
3. Follow the on-screen questions and input your answers.

## Scoring 🏅

- Start with 1000 points for the first correct answer.
- Points double exponentially for each correct answer using:  
`points = 1000 * 2^i` where `i` is the question index (starting from 0).
- Incorrect answers after the first question allow you to keep your current score.
